##Camaraderie
###A theme for Google Chrome browser
Just made it out of boredom :P
Found this amazing polygonal image on [Graphics Fuel](http://www.graphicsfuel.com/2014/09/10-free-polygon-backgrounds/) and decided to use it as my browser background.

And its customizable! Download the package, resize your favorite image to atleast your screen resolution, name it as bg-ntp.png (no other filetype would work!) and replace the existing image in the images folder. Similarly, resize another of your favorite image to a minimum of your screen width but keep its height between 100-200 pixels and rename it as bg-top.png.

###Installation:
* Jump to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode.
* Click on 'Load unpacked extension...'
* Select the Camaraderie folder and hit OK (literally!)
* Rainbow :)
